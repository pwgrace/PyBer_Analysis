### It can be inferred from the line chart above that:
#### The total fares are consistently highest in Urban areas and lowest in Rural areas
#### There was a peak towards the end of February for all three areas
#### There are local minimums and maximums but there are no major trends apparent over the short time horizon for any area
## Summary
#### It is recommended that PyBer scale up in a few Urban markets to maximize cash flow before expanding heavily in different types of new markets.
#### It is recommended that PyBer invest in marketing in Urban markets so that the total rides can overtake the total number of drivers. 
#### It is recommended that PyBer implement tipping in Urban markets to increase the Average Fare per Driver.
